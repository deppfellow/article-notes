This is an article notes and summary of [Design Systems Class Series](https://www.designsystems.com/space-grids-and-layouts/)

## What spatial system?

From height of button to space around the icon, all its called spatial decisions. *Spatial system* is **a set of rules for how you measure, size, and space your UI elements**.



## How to start with spatial system?

First, defining your base unit to create the scale of your supported spatial system. Many such as 4pt, 5pt, 6pt, 8pt, 10pt linear increment system. There is no wrong answer.

My preferred spatial system is using linear scale with: 

-   8pt for elements
-   4pt with half-step for spacing icons and small text blocks
-   4pt with baseline grid for typography (i.e. it means that the line-height of font choices will always be divisible by 4)



## How to apply spatial system?

Applying spatial scale to UI elements can come in: padding, margin, height and width.

# Wrapping Up

In short, when starting to create design and spatial systems, create a wireframe and start to define your choices of spacing:
